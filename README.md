# Neighbor Relations Matter in Video Scene Detection
This is an official PyTorch Implementation of **Neighbor Relations Matter in Video Scene Detection**.

## Prepare Dataset
1. Refer to https://github.com/mini-mind/VSMBD
2. The unsupervised learning settings also refer to https://github.com/mini-mind/VSMBD, 
and the label generation method is changed to https://github.com/kakaobrain/bassl

## Supervised Model
A better learning strategy may have better results. 

The following checkpoint is what I trained casually.

mAP:64.1, mIoU:59.2, F1:57.3
